I'm a Senior Lecturer (~Associate Professor) in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield, co-affiliated with the Machine Learning (ML) group. Previously, I was a Lecturer in Data Science at the Information School, University of Sheffield. I've gained industrial experience working as a scientist at Amazon (Amazon ML and Alexa). I was a research associate at UCL, Department of Computer Science and I completed a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Sheffield, Department of Computer Science. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/). For more details, see my [CV](http://naletras.github.io/files/nikos_cv.pdf)

My research interests are in NLP, Machine Learning and Data Science. Specifically, I'm interested in developing computational methods for social media analysis and the law, ML for NLP and information retrieval methods for improving access to large document collections. For more details, see my [publications](publications.md). My research has been funded by the EPSRC, ESRC, Leverhulme Trust, Amazon and Google.
