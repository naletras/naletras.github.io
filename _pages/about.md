**Bio:** I am a Professor of Natural Language Processing (NLP), currently leading the [NLP Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the School of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. I'm also an Amazon Scholar within the Rufus Science team. Prieviously, I've gained industrial experience working as an Applied scientist at Amazon (Amazon ML and Alexa). Prior to Amazon, I was a research associate at UCL, Department of Computer Science after I completed a PhD in Natural Language Processing at the University of Sheffield, Department of Computer Science. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/). 

**Research:** My research interests focus on developing data and resource efficient methods for language modelling, model interpretability, and applications of language technology in computational social science and law. In 2016, I pioneered the first approach to model judicial decisions using NLP. My work has received wide media coverage from various news outlets inlcuding the BBC, the Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the New Scientist and the Communications of ACM, inter alia. My research has been funded by the EPSRC, ESRC, Leverhulme Trust, EU, Amazon, Google and AstraZeneca.
